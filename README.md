### Ellie Lockhart, Full Stack Developer and Data Scientist


I am a data scientist with seven years of experience as an academic researcher and teacher, who has now turned my full attention to software development and data gathering and analysis in the so-called "real world." I've already [been interviewed about my research in the press](https://observer.com/2020/09/lgbt-film-representation-data-ellie-lockhart/) and am working on refining my ongoing projects; I also maintain a blog about my findings and my journey toward becoming an even more proficient researcher [on Medium](https://medium.com/out-of-the-midwest-with-software-data).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data harvesting from various entertainment-related websites to gather public opinion data about films and video games.
- ðŸŒ± Through this, I'm improving my understanding of JavaScript, the HTML DOM, and automated data gathering, as well as managing SQL databases (a topic in which I have significant experience!)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on hobby gaming projects, including an attempt to create a React.js and Node-based text game engine similar to Twine, but with an expanded feature set influenced by both classic Infocom games (inventory and mapping features) and AAA story game narrative devices like in-game diaries kept by characters. I'm also always interested in answering data questions that others have, and I encourage you to reach out to me about those.
