### Ellie Lockhart, Software Developer, Data Engineer, & Data Scientist

> We've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. It seems that you've been leading two lives. In one of these lives you are a **program writer for a respectable software company...** 
>> Agent Smith, *The Matrix* (1999)

I am a data scientist with ten years of professional experience, much of it as an academic researcher and teacher, who now wishes to become a program writer for a respectable software company. No "red pill" for me! I'm currently working as a freelance/independent software developer and data researcher, and have been working to build data pipelines and analysis frameworks to produce actionable insights. I've already [been interviewed about my research in the press](https://observer.com/2020/09/lgbt-film-representation-data-ellie-lockhart/) and am working on refining my ongoing projects; I also maintain a blog about my findings and my journey toward becoming an even more proficient researcher [on Medium](https://medium.com/out-of-the-midwest-with-software-data). Moreover, I am working on several projects, most of which are housed here in various public and private repositories.

Key skills you can count on me for include, but are not limited to:
> 10+ years experience coding in professional & independent contexts â€¢ Python â€¢ SQL â€¢ NoSQL â€¢ Flask â€¢ R â€¢ Machine Learning (NLP, statistical operations, in both R and Python) â€¢ Linux server administration (incl. Bash shell scripting) â€¢ Google Cloud Platform (GCP) â€¢ AWS â€¢ Data Analytics â€¢ Business Communication â€¢ Interpersonal Communication â€¢ JavaScript â€¢ TypeScript â€¢ Graph databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) â€¢ Natural Language Processing â€¢ Apache Spark â€¢ Statistics â€¢ Business Communication â€¢ Interpersonal Communication

Completed projects include:
- A **[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ellielockhart/metacritic-rotten-tomatoes-controversial-reviews) of reviews of controversial films and video games** developed as part of my ongoing natural language research and offered for the use of anyone interested in the use of review bombing. [Github repository](https://github.com/EllieLockhart/Metacritic---Rotten-Tomatoes-Controversial-Reviews-Dataset)

Ongoing projects:

- I'm building on the above data set with Java, Scala, Python, and R data modeling techniques to develop an algorithm to allow companies to better identify which product reviews, particularly for entertainment products, are genuine.
- ðŸŒ± I'm working on a blog project similar to Medium which will use Java, Spring Boot, and Neo4j to make a reactive, creator-centered engine for recommendation-driven blogging, and I'm interested in taking this further as a business opportunity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on hobby gaming projects, including an attempt to create a React.js and Node-based text game engine similar to Twine, but with an expanded feature set influenced by both classic Infocom games (inventory and mapping features) and AAA story game narrative devices like in-game diaries kept by characters. I'm also always interested in answering data questions that others have, and I encourage you to reach out to me about those.
- ðŸ“« You can get ahold of me at elliedev at protonmail dot com and I'm always happy to chat about code, geeky things, or professional opportunities.
