- data collection and scraping apps using Python (and other languages as needed); these apps are designed to aid in data analysis projects to answer specific questions;
- data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting using Python and iPython/Jupyter notebooks to answer specific research questions;
- developing a set of sample web and mobile applications using Javascript & related frameworks, Java, Kotlin, Google's Flutter UI system, and of course HTML5/CSS as needed
- as a side project, experimenting with scientific and quantitative data visualization using C# and Unity

Ellie's goal is to seek employment in web development, app development, and/or data science as soon as possible! She can be contacted at lytellie at gmail dot com.
